    Human is more sensitive on black and white than colors. It is useful to whittle the signal of the colors,
    so that the amount of the information which will be transmitted will be reduced. 
    It is hard to distinguish the difference between to subsampling one and non-subsampling one, for human normally.
    So the subsampling is a good idea, and an useful
    way when transmitting and storing the data.
